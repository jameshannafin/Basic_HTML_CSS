This is the repository for HTML and CSS course.
I learned alot of things on my time here, but also spent more time than I should have. 

I dont know how to link to the projects I have created, but I will learn to do so.


I created a one page website with a nice gallery that was my introduction to CSS.

My final challenge project is another one paige website I made entirely from scatch.

My bootstrap project is the poject hwere I learned how to use the boot strap frame work.

I have a portfolio website that I will use to display and link to my work.S

All of these projects will serve as valuable reference points in time to come.
