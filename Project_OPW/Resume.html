<br>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
    I am a driven full-stack develop and continuous student of software design and development.
    I am fluid with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python along with various extensions;
    most importantly is that I know how to learn new things. I am a soon-to-be graduate of The Tech Academy's 
    Software Development Bootcamp and have become well acclimated with the workflow of a collaborative team. 
    Before that, I have years of experience in designing and scripting indie games for PC which, I believe, 
    brings an important way of thinking to the design of any application.
